# Employee Wage Computation System

Welcome to the **Employee Wage Computation System**, a C# Console Application built using **.NET Framework**.  
This project calculates employee wages for different companies based on multiple use cases.  

## 📌 **Project Structure**
The project is managed with **GitHub branching**, where each **Use Case (UC1 - UC10)** is implemented in separate branches.  
- **`main` branch** → Contains only this `README.md` file.  
- **`dev` branch** → Base development branch (empty initially).  
- **Feature Branches (UC1 - UC10)** → Each use case is implemented in a different branch.

## 🚀 **How to Use This Repository**
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone  https://github.com/Aniket19c/Employee_Wage.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:  
   ```sh
   cd Employee_Wage
   ```
3. Checkout the `dev` branch to start development:  
   ```sh
   git checkout dev
   ```
4. Switch to any feature branch to see a specific use case:  
   ```sh
   git checkout UC1  # Example for Use Case 1
   ```

## 📂 **Use Cases Implemented**
| Use Case | Description |
|----------|------------|
| **UC1** | Check Employee Presence |
| **UC2** | Calculate Daily Employee Wage |
| **UC3** | Add Part-Time Employee and Wage |
| **UC4** | Compute Wage Using Switch Case |
| **UC5** | Compute Monthly Wage (20 Working Days Assumed) |
| **UC6** | Compute Wages Until Max Working Hours or Days |
| **UC7** | Refactor Code Using Class Methods |
| **UC8** | Compute Wages for Multiple Companies |
| **UC9** | Store Total Wage for Each Company |
| **UC10** | Implement Interface for Wage Calculation |

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**
- **C#**
- **.NET Framework**
- **Git & GitHub** for version control  

## 📜 **Branching Strategy**
- The `main` branch contains only `README.md`.  
- The `dev` branch is used for merging all feature branches.  
- Each use case (UC1 - UC10) is implemented in separate branches.
